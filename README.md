## üõ†Ô∏è Experience
### **Undergraduate Research**  
- **[Technology on the Trail Lab](https://techonthetrail.net/)**: Fine-tuned **Mistral 7B** for an AI-powered writing feedback system, enabling personalized insights on student essays. Engineered backend solutions using **embeddings**, **K-Means clustering**, and **RAG** to analyze writing trends and support professors with data-driven feedback.  
- **[IDEEAS Lab](https://ideeaslab.com/members)**: Conducted sentiment analysis and topic modeling on social media data to explore public perceptions of generative AI in education. Combined **BERT-based models** and **LLMs**, with LLM achieving **30% higher accuracy**. Published and presented findings at the **IEEE Frontiers in Education (FIE) Conference**, highlighting a **57% positive sentiment** toward AI in education.

### **Software Engineer Intern** at [Fasoo](https://www.fasoo.com)  
- Developed a high-performance **speech-to-speech platform** on AWS EC2, integrating **real-time transcription** using **OpenAI's Whisper**, **WebSockets**, and advanced **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**. Achieved a **60% speed improvement** while supporting 100K+ concurrent users with low latency.
