### Hi, I'm Sunggyeol 👋

#### I am a Computer Science student at Virginia Tech, part of the class of 2026, with a minor in Human-Computer Interaction. Currently, I am serving as a remote Android Developer Intern at Nest, a Korean property tech startup. My passion lies in HCI and visualization research, and I aspire to contribute to innovative projects that intersect technology with the human experience.
